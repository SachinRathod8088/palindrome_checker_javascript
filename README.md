Palindrome Checker Web Application
This repository hosts a web-based Palindrome Checker, designed for simple and effective palindrome verification. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, disregarding spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Key Features
1.Input Validation: Robust cleaning of input by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting the text to lowercase for accurate palindrome checks.

2.Interactive Web Interface: User-friendly interface allowing users to input a word or phrase.

3.Dynamic Results: Real-time display of results on the webpage, clearly indicating whether the input is a palindrome.

4.Modern Design: A visually appealing and responsive web interface styled with CSS for an enhanced user experience.

## How to Use
1.Open the web page in a browser.

2.Enter a word or phrase in the input field.

3.Click the "Check" button.

The result will be displayed on the page, indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Implementation Details
The palindrome checking functionality is implemented in JavaScript. Input processing involves removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting the text to lowercase. Subsequently, the cleaned string is compared to its reverse to determine if it is a palindrome.

The web interface is created with HTML and styled using CSS. Interaction between the interface and the palindrome checking logic is facilitated by JavaScript.

## Development Environment
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Browser-based development
## Project Structure
1.index.html: Primary HTML file defining the structure of the web page.
